			<h5><b>The Hoteikan System</b></h5>
			<p>The Hoteikan System seeks to establish perfection of character, spiritual and physical well being, and dedication to the Martial Arts. These principles are reflected in the Hoteikan Dojo Kun. The System has three major components: Jujitsu, Karate, and Judo. These are taught individually, or in combination with the parent Hoteikan Martial Art System<br>
			In addition to these major Arts, the Hoteikan System has taken the very best of many other Arts to form a complete System with self preservation and the perfection of character in mind. To this goal our members from around the nation meet 2 times per year to share these ideals and continue our journey through the Martial Arts, under the tutelage of Shodai Soke Emilio Claudio and Soke Santiago Armstrong.<br>
			We currently have thousands of students and members around the world, both in the Military protecting our country and in the private sector. In addition, we have member schools in: New York, Arizona, Georgia, and South Dakota & New Jersey.<br>
			Our Mission is simple, The Hoteikan System is a complete Martial Arts system, come train with us and spread the word! www.hoteikan.com &#46;</p>		

<br>
			<h5><b>What is Karate&#63;</b></h5>
			<p>Karate, literally meaning <span style="color: red;">"Empty Hand"</span> is a system of unarmed defense. It is based on discipline of the mind 					and body. </p>

			<p>It includes training to develop balance which enhances your understanding of leverage and generation of power. It involved blocking, 				striking, kicking and countering all manner of attack. </p>	
			
<br>
			<h5><b>JUDO</b></h5>
			<p>Judo is the sport of jujitsu. During a time of change in Japan a man named Jigoro Kano wanted to preserve the timeless qualities of traditional jujitsu – loyalty, discipline, resolve, honor, morality – and discard the qualities in which the martial artist learns techniques to hurt, maim and kill. To do this, Kano made judo a safe, rewarding and challenging sport for the evolution of Jujitsu. Judo consists of rolls, falls, joint locks, grappling, throws, and take downs as a safer way to compete with your Jujitsu techniques.</p>		

<br>			
			<h5><b>What is Jujitsu&#63;</b></h5>			
			<p>Jujitsu literally meaning <span style="color: red;">"The Gentle Art"</span> is an ancient form of self-defense based on using the natural 					flow of an attacker against themselves. It includes joint locks, grappling, arresting and striking with the least amount of effort through 					maximum efficiency.</p>		

<br>
			<h5><b>What is Kardio-Kickboxing&#63;</b></h5>
  			<p>This fitness craze has rocked the nation! Now America's favorite way to shape up and rated #1 calorie burning workout while learning self defense skills.</p>

  			<p>Kickboxing combines the hands of western boxing and the kicks of eastern karate.</p>
  			
<br>  			

			<h5><b>Adults</b></h5>
  			<p>We have &#34;adult only&#34; classes in Karate, Jujitsu, Kicboxing &#38; MMA.  Whether you would like to get in great shape, stay in shape, learn to defend yourself or earn the degree of Black Belt, the Hoteikan Dojo Adult program is safe, practical &#38; challenging.</p>

<br>

			<h5><b>Children's Program</b></h5>
  			<p>At the Hoteikan Dojo, our children's programs are second to none. We realize that although the ability to defend oneself is important, 				there are other benefits children can receive from being involved in the Martial Arts. This is why our unique program of work and fun is 				designed to instill&#58;	

  				 	<p>&#9679; Effort and Concentration</p>
  				 	<p>&#9679; Character and Self Esteem</p>
  				 	<p>&#9679; Sincerity and Respect</p>
  				 	<p>&#9679; Etiquette</p>
		  				 
  			<p>By embodying the above principles into our children's self defense classes, the Hoteikan Dojo 					 has made a strong commitment to the development of today's youth. Children can start with our 					 Pre-K karate program for ages 3 through 5. This class prepares them for our Lil'Dragons class, 				 ages 5 through 7. Children can then enter our kid's class, ages 8 through teen, where they learn 					 to think memorize, and concentrate in a fun way. Our special structured programs will improve 					 your child's performance in all other sports as well as improving study habits and 				 					 concentration.</p>

<br>

			<h5><b>Competition</b></h5>
  			<p>If you have the desire to compete as a martial art athlete, Hoteikan has what you need. We have 				produced Local, Regional, National and World Champions. Your competition training can include 				Karate, Judo, Jujitsu or MMA, Extreme Team Martial Arts League.</p>

  			<p>The Hoteikan System also hosts several events annually which includes Seminars, Tournaments for 				kids and adults, Family Events, and additional activities.</p>

<br>

			<h5><b>Zumba</b></h5> 	
  			<p>Zumba Fitness® is the only Latin-inspired dance-fitness program that blends red-hot 		 				international music, created by Grammy Award-winning producers, and contagious steps to form a 				"fitness-party" that is downright addictive. Since its inception in 2001, the Zumba program has 			grown to become the world's largest &#8211; and most successful &#8211; dance-fitness program with more than 14 				million people of all shapes, sizes and ages taking weekly Zumba classes in over 140,000 locations 			across more than 150 countries.</p>	

<br>
			<h5><b>Zumbatomic</b></h5>
  			<p>Designed exclusively for kids (ages 4-12), Zumbatomic classes are rockin&#8217;, high-energy 				fitness-parties packed with specially choreographed, kid-friendly routines and all the music kids 				love, like hip-hop, reggaeton, cumbia and more. Parents love Zumbatomic because of the effects it 				has on kids, increasing their focus and self-confidence, boosting metabolism and enhancing 				coordination. Zumbatomic rounds out family fitness goals by giving parents a great reason to head to 				the gym &#8211; for themselves, for their kids, for a totally fun family experience.</p>
